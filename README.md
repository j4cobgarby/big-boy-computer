# Intro

A very simple CPU emulator written in c++, inspired by [LMC](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) for me to learn how a cpu works in more detail.

Current features:
 - Fetch-decode-execute cycle
 - 32-bit architecture (256 CPU instructions)

# Building

Make sure you have:
 - g++
 - cmake
 - sfml (for pixel plotting)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j4cobgarby/big-boy-computer.git
$ cd big-boy-computer/build
$ # Depending on your setup, you may want to modify link_directories and
$ # include_directories in CMakeLists.txt.
$ cmake ../src -G "<Insert your favourite Makefiles type here>"
$ make
```

# Intro

A very simple CPU emulator written in c++, inspired by [LMC](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) for me to learn how a cpu works in more detail.

Current features:
 - Fetch-decode-execute cycle
 - 32-bit architecture (256 CPU instructions)

# Building

Make sure you have g++ installed, then..

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j4cobgarby/big-boy-computer.git
$ cd big-boy-computer
$ g++ main.cpp
$ ./a.out # This command may vary depending on your machine. Just run the executable.
```

# `INSTRUCTIONS`

```
(refer to the INSTRUCTIONS file for the instructions reference.)
```

# Intro

A very simple CPU emulator written in c++, for me to learn how a cpu works in more detail.

Current features:
 - Fetch-decode-execute cycle
 - 16 machine code instructions (10 actually implemented)

Refer to `INSTRUCTIONS` for the machine code docs.

# Building

Make sure you have g++ installed

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j4cobgarby/big-boy-computer.git
$ cd big-boy-computer
$ g++ main.cpp
$ ./a.out # This command may vary depending on your machine. Just run the executable.
```
